Can you do the following without using subquery?: {1,None,1,2,None} --> [1,1,1,2,2] Ensure you take care of case input[None] which means None object
Complete a function that returns a list containing all the mismatched words (case sensitive) between two given input strings # For example: # - string 1 : "Firstly this is the first string" # - string 2 : "Next is the second string" # # - output : ['Firstly', 'this', 'first', 'Next', 'second']
Complete a function that returns the number of times a given character occurs in the given string.
# For example:
# - input string = "mississippi"

#
# - output : 4

Given an array containing None values fill in the None values with most recent non None value in the array. For example:input array: [1,None,2,3,None,None,5,None] # - output array: [1,1,2,3,3,3,5,5]
Complete a function that returns a list containing all the mismatched words (case sensitive) between two given input strings # For example: string 1 : "Firstly this is the first string" # - string 2 : "Next is the second string" # # - output : ['Firstly', 'this', 'first', 'Next', 'second']
Given an array of integers, we would like to determine whether the array is monotonic (non-decreasing/non-increasing) or not. Examples:
 // 1 2 5 5 8
// true
// 9 4 4 2 2
// true
// 1 4 6 3
// false
//1 1 1 1 1 1
// true

Given a dictionary, print the key for nth highest value present in the dict. If there are more than 1 record present for nth highest value then sort the key and print the first one
Flatten a nested dictionary
You have a 2-D array of friends like [[A,B],[A,C],[B,D],[B,C],[R,M], [S],[P], [A]]. Write a function that creates a dictionary of how many friends each person has. People can have 0 to many friends. However, there won't be repeat relationships like [A,B] and [B,A] and neither will there be more than 2 people in a relationship

Learn about Facebookâ€™s culture
Most candidates fail to do this. But before investing tens of hours preparing for an interview at Facebook, you should take some time to make sure it's actually the right company for you.

Facebook is prestigious and it's therefore tempting to ignore that step completely. But in our experience, the prestige in itself won't make you happy day-to-day. It's the type of work and the people you work with that will.

If you know engineers who work at Facebook (or used to), it's a good idea to talk to them to understand what the culture is like. In addition, we would recommend reading about Facebook's 5 core values and hacker culture.
