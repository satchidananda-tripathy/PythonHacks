'''given a list of tuples of movie watched times, find how many unique minutes of the movie did
the viewer watch
e.g. [(0,15),(10,25)]. The viewer watched 25 minutes of the movie.
first value in tuple is start time and second value is end time.. the user watched multiple time to
 finish the movie
 Observer.. there are overlap between start time.
'''

t = [(0, 15), (10, 25), (12, 20), (30, 48)]


#Good idea to sort it by start time to know if there is a rewind e.g in (0, 15), (10, 25) user rewind for 5 mins
